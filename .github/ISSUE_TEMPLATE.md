<!--
Before submitting the issue please search the existing issues and also review Frequently Asked Questions: https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv/blob/master/FAQ.md

This template is for bug reports. For other issues please use one of the following links:

- propose a new feature/option or some other improvement: https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#changes
- report compatibility issues: https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#compatibility
- using JSON-Schema standard: https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#json-schema

Please note: leaving sections blank, posting large schemas or data samples makes it more time consuming to resolve the issue - I would really appreciate the time you spend providing all the information and reducing both your schema and data to the smallest possible size when they still have the issue.

Simplifying the issue would also make it more valuable for other users (in cases it turns out to be an incorrect usage rather than a bug).

Thank you!
